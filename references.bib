	abstract = {For at least the past five decades population genetics, as a field, has worked to describe the precise balance of forces that shape patterns of variation in genomes. The problem is challenging because modelling the interactions between evolutionary processes is difficult, and different processes can impact genetic variation in similar ways. In this paper, we describe how diversity and divergence between closely related species change with time, using correlations between landscapes of genetic variation as a tool to understand the interplay between evolutionary processes. We find strong correlations between landscapes of diversity and divergence in a well sampled set of great ape genomes, and explore how various processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, mutation rate variation, GC-biased gene conversion and selection contribute to these correlations. Through highly realistic, chromosome-scale, forward-in-time simulations we show that the landscapes of diversity and divergence in the great apes are too well correlated to be explained via strictly neutral processes alone. Our best fitting simulation includes both deleterious and beneficial mutations in functional portions of the genome, in which \$9{\textbackslash}\%\$ of fixations within those regions is driven by positive selection. This study provides a framework for modelling genetic variation in closely related species, an approach which can shed light on the complex balance of forces that have shaped genetic variation.},

  abstract = {Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features of genomic datasets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available genetic data, and the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear what information is required to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six well-characterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020). Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in the catalog more than threefold and broadened coverage across the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common sticking points and developed the best practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.},

Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure and the tskit library. We summarize msprime’s many features, and show that its performance is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized alternatives.

Classical formalisms have focused on mapping coalescence and recombination events to the nodes in an ARG. However, this approach is out of step with some modern developments, which do not represent genetic inheritance in terms of these events or explicitly infer them. We present a simple formalism that defines an ARG in terms of specific genomes and their intervals of genetic inheritance, and show how it generalizes these classical treatments and encompasses the outputs of recent methods. We discuss nuances arising from this more general structure, and argue that it forms an appropriate basis for a software standard in this rapidly growing field.},

Despite its potential utility, technological and methodological limitations, along with a lack of approachable literature, have severely restricted awareness and application of ARGs in evolution research. Excitingly, recent progress in ARG reconstruction and simulation have made ARG-based approaches feasible for many questions and systems. In this review, we provide an accessible introduction and exploration of ARGs, survey recent methodological breakthroughs, and describe the potential for ARGs to further existing goals and open avenues of inquiry that were previously inaccessible in evolutionary genomics.

Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a summary function; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics’ relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher, Thornton, Ashander,  (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using ?recapitation?; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population's genealogy that can be analysed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modelling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly ‘simplify’ a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation’s entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.},

We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods.

This extension maintains stdpopsim’s core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps. This extension to stdpopsim provides a powerful new resource for the population genetics community to explore the interplay between selection and other evolutionary forces in a reproducible, low-barrier framework.},

	abstract = {The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly, these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here, we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.},

Indeed, to our knowledge no general-purpose, flexible modeling framework exists that provides support for simulating multiple species while also providing other key features, such as explicit genetics and continuous space. The lack of such software has limited our ability to model higher biological levels such as communities, ecosystems, coevolutionary and eco-evolutionary processes, and biodiversity, which is crucial for many purposes, from extending our basic understanding of evolutionary ecology to informing conservation and management decisions. We here announce the release of SLiM 4, which fills this important gap by adding support for multiple species, including ecological interactions between species such as predation, parasitism, and mutualism, and illustrate its new features with examples.},

	abstract = {An alteration to the life cycle was a fundamental early step in the evolution of land plants. The ancestors of land plants likely spent most of their lives as a multicellular haploid organism, known as the gametophyte phase, and entered a single-celled diploid zygote phase only rarely. This changed in early land plants, which developed a multicellular diploid embryo that grew into a multicellular diploid body called the sporophyte phase. Since then, land plants have evolved the full spectrum of relative dependence between phases, i.e. they exhibit sporophyte-dominant, gametophyte-dominant, and co-dominant life cycles. Such foundational changes to the plant life cycle were critical for the establishment of early plants on land and have remained a central aspect of land plant evolution, but beyond this, little detail is known about the early steps in land plant evolution. 
    
  Ferns are the only extant land plant lineage in which both life phases are independent and photosynthetic. They also occupy a key phylogenetic position as sister to the most diverse group of land plants (seed plants), thus both their life cycle and their evolutionary history is intermediate between those of the other major plant lineages. Ferns have been historically underutilized in genomic studies due to the difficulty of sequencing their genomes. 

However, with advances in sequencing technology and reduction in costs, it has recently become feasible to develop genomic resources in ferns. Additionally, the fern gametophyte – once thought to be relatively unimportant, or even a “handicap” in the fern life cycle – has been an overlooked, but consequential, aspect of land plant evolution. The free-living gametophyte is a salient feature of the fern life cycle and more broadly the life cycles of early-diverging groups of land plants, while the fern sporophyte is similar to the sporophyte of seed plants, which predominate in botanical research. Thus, research in ferns bridges a gap in existing data from disparate lineages.

      In this dissertation I utilize ferns, and the fern gametophyte in particular, to address open questions about the origin, evolution, and development of land plants. In Chapter 1, I develop a computational tool called shadie for simulating genome evolution under realistic plant life cycle models to explore the evolutionary consequences of co-dominant fern life cycles compared to those with less independent stages. Simulations using this tool demonstrate that fixation probability of new mutations and patterns of linkage change due to life cycle alone, suggesting that the relative dominance of phases in plant life cycles has likely influenced the long-term evolution of the major lineages in different ways and may be a key characteristic for understanding why they are so distinct from one another.

 In Chapter 2 I focus on a key trait of the gametophyte, the gametangia (sex organs), to generate testable hypotheses about this aspect of the evolution and development of land plants and larger trends in land plant evolution. I review 150 years of botanical literature on the subject of gametangia morphology and development to generate an eight-stage ontogenic framework that unites the development of the female and male sex organs of land plants and proposes homologies across all land plant lineages. This review synthesizes data from diverse fields and sometimes elusive sources to identify clear future research directions.

      In Chapter 3 I collect the first high resolution transcriptomic time series dataset of gametophyte development in the model fern, Ceratopteris richardii. I use this dataset to characterize differential gene expression changes throughout the fern life cycle, identify transcription factors specific to developmental stages, assign gene specificity to one phase or the other, and test a century-old hypothesis about the origin of land plants. In Chapter 4 I extend this pipeline to a comparative study utilizing 11 species of field-collected sporophytes and lab-reared gametophytes and implement the McDonald-Kreitman test to measure selection. Results from these chapters reveal a consistently high degree of gene expression overlap between the gametophyte and sporophyte, adding to growing evidence that ferns may experience a high degree of pleiotropy between life phases. We also discover that phase-specific genes experience higher rates of adaptive evolution than genes that are shared by both phases, which could suggest that gene-sharing between phases causes selection to act with less efficiency. 

      Finally, in Chapter 5 I reconstruct the evolution of an ancient family of homeodomain proteins called TALE, incorporating sequences from ferns, lycophytes, and gymnosperms, which were not available for use in earlier reconstructions. I then use in situ hybridization to characterize the spatial gene expression of all fourteen copies of TALE genes in C. richardii in both gametophyte and sporophyte tissues. This study contributes to resolving the TALE phylogeny, which has proven difficult to reconstruct, and assigns previously unidentified TALE genes to their respective clades. This study clarifies evolutionary relationships between TALE genes in land plants, characterize their expression patterns in ferns, and results suggest that at least some copies of ferns retain their ancestral functions.  This study is also the first to demonstrate clear evidence that TALE proteins are involved in gametophyte body plan patterning in land plants.},

	abstract = {Real geography is continuous, but standard models in population genetics are based on discrete, well-mixed populations. As a result, many methods of analyzing genetic data assume that samples are a random draw from a well-mixed population, but are applied to clustered samples from populations that are structured clinally over space. Here, we use simulations of populations living in continuous geography to study the impacts of dispersal and sampling strategy on population genetic summary statistics, demographic inference, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We find that most common summary statistics have distributions that differ substantially from those seen in well-mixed populations, especially when Wright’s neighborhood size is \&lt; 100 and sampling is spatially clustered. “Stepping-stone” models reproduce some of these effects, but discretizing the landscape introduces artifacts that in some cases are exacerbated at higher resolutions. The combination of low dispersal and clustered sampling causes demographic inference from the site frequency spectrum to infer more turbulent demographic histories, but averaged results across multiple simulations revealed surprisingly little systematic bias. We also show that the combination of spatially autocorrelated environments and limited dispersal causes GWAS to identify spurious signals of genetic association with purely environmentally determined phenotypes, and that this bias is only partially corrected by regressing out principal components of ancestry. Last, we discuss the relevance of our simulation results for inference from genetic variation in real organisms.},

	abstract = {Forward-in-time population genetic simulations enable modelling of a wide array of complex evolutionary scenarios. Simulating small genomic regions, and rescaling by reducing population size by a scaling factor while maintaining population-scaled parameters, are common approaches for improving computational tractability. However, simulating whole chromosomes in large populations remains computationally prohibitive and it’s unclear what scaling factors produce consistent evolutionary dynamics between rescaled and unscaled populations. Here, we thoroughly test the effects of rescaling in populations experiencing direct and linked effects of selection for various scaling factors and genomic lengths in D. melanogaster-like populations by comparing them with theoretical expectations. We find that while rescaling has minimal effects with most length and scaling factor combinations, simulating long regions with large scaling factors can introduce biases in summary statistics including neutral diversity, allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, and non-neutral divergence. These deviations occur particularly when the crossover rate exceeds 0.44 per individual/generation because substantial multiple-crossover events are likely to occur within individuals, reducing the effective rate of genetic recombination. In addition, when the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate is high (U ≫ 1) in highly rescaled long regions, we observe increased Hill-Robertson interference effects and progeny skew, the extent of which was strongly dependent on the fitness effects of selected mutations. We find that hitchhiking effects near functional regions are relatively unaffected by rescaling the population, even with large scaling factors. Our findings expose potential pitfalls when simulating long regions with rescaling and highlight parameter spaces within which expected evolutionary dynamics are conserved.},

Forward-in-time simulations are especially flexible, allowing for various types of natural selection, complex genetic architectures, and non-Wright–Fisher dynamics. However, their intense computational requirements can be prohibitive to simulating large populations and genomes. A popular method to alleviate this burden is to scale down the population size by some scaling factor while scaling up the mutation rate, selection coefficients, and recombination rate by the same factor. However, this rescaling approach may in some cases bias simulation results. To investigate the manner and degree to which rescaling impacts simulation outcomes, we carried out simulations with different demographic histories and distributions of fitness effects using several values of the rescaling factor, Q, and compared the deviation of key outcomes (fixation times, allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, and the fraction of mutations that fix during the simulation) between the scaled and unscaled simulations. Our results indicate that scaling introduces substantial biases to each of these measured outcomes, even at small values of Q. Moreover, the nature of these effects depends on the evolutionary model and scaling factor being examined. While increasing the scaling factor tends to increase the observed biases, this relationship is not always straightforward; thus, it may be difficult to know the impact of scaling on simulation outcomes a priori. However, it appears that for most models, only a small number of replicates was needed to accurately quantify the bias produced by rescaling for a given Q. In summary, while rescaling forward-in-time simulations may be necessary in many cases, researchers should be aware of the rescaling procedure's impact on simulation outcomes and consider investigating its magnitude in smaller scale simulations of the desired model(s) before selecting an appropriate value of Q.},

Using allele frequencies and association effects as examples, we show that computation on GRG via graph traversal runs the fastest among all tested alternatives.

  abstract = {Motivation: Simulation under the coalescent model is ubiquitous in the analysis of genetic data. The
rapid growth of real data sets from multiple human populations led to increasing interest in simulat-
ing very large sample sizes at whole-chromosome scales. When the sample size is large, the coales-
cent model becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation of the discrete time Wright-Fisher
model (DTWF). Analytical and computational treatment of the DTWF, however, is generally harder.
Results: We present a simulator (ARGON) for the DTWF process that scales up to hundreds of thou-
sands of samples and whole-chromosome lengths, with a time/memory performance comparable
or superior to currently available methods for coalescent simulation. The simulator supports arbi-
trary demographic history, migration, Newick tree output, variable mutation/recombination rates
and gene conversion, and efﬁciently outputs pairwise identical-by-descent sharing data.

@article{lewanski2024introduction,
  abstract = {In the presence of recombination, the evolutionary relationships between a set of sampled genomes cannot be described by a single genealogical tree. Instead, the genomes are related by a complex, interwoven collection of genealogies formalized in a structure called an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). An ARG extensively encodes the ancestry of the genome(s) and thus is replete with valuable information for addressing diverse questions in evolutionary biology. Despite its potential utility, technological and methodological limitations, along with a lack of approachable literature, have severely restricted awareness and application of ARGs in evolution research. Excitingly, recent progress in ARG reconstruction and simulation have made ARG-based approaches feasible for many questions and systems. In this review, we provide an accessible introduction and exploration of ARGs, survey recent methodological breakthroughs, and describe the potential for ARGs to further existing goals and open avenues of inquiry that were previously inaccessible in evolutionary genomics. Through this discussion, we aim to more widely disseminate the promise of ARGs in evolutionary genomics and encourage the broader development and adoption of ARG-based inference.},

@article{johnson2024population,
  abstract = {Abstract Population genetic simulation has emerged as a common tool for investigating increasingly complex evolutionary and demographic models. Software capable of handling high-level model complexity has recently been developed, and the advancement of tree sequence recording now allows simulations to merge the efficiency and genealogical insight of coalescent simulations with the flexibility of forward simulations. However, frameworks utilizing these features have not yet been compared and benchmarked. Here, we evaluate various simulation workflows using the coalescent simulator msprime and the forward simulator SLiM, to assess resource efficiency and determine an optimal simulation framework. Three aspects were evaluated: (1) the burn-in, to establish an equilibrium level of neutral diversity in the population; (2) the forward simulation, in which temporally fluctuating selection is acting; and (3) the final computation of summary statistics. We provide typical memory and computation time requirements for each step. We find that the fastest framework, a combination of coalescent and forward simulation with tree sequence recording, increases simulation speed by over twenty times compared to classical forward simulations without tree sequence recording, although it does require six times more memory. Overall, using efficient simulation workflows can lead to a substantial improvement when modelling complex evolutionary scenarios—although the optimal framework ultimately depends on the available computational resources.},
